### Originally a 5 week test for myself in React-Native.
The idea for this cross platform mobile application would be targeted at short term memory individuals.
From the main menu, you'd create a new list, and then set a pin in google maps for the list. (Think groceries or the DMV)
When you get within a certain distance to the pin it would send the user a notifcation that they had a list created for that location.

### Completed milestones
Done:
- Initial menu.
- Creation of lists that save to the users device.
- Lists that saved to the users device.

Not complete:
- Integration of Google Maps.
- Notifications sent to users phone.

I have now an opportunity to finish this, seeing as I have committed studies to JavaScript libraries / React a little more, I inted on progressing this persnal project some more.
